# FCSC 2025

FCSC is the France Cyber Security Challenge organised by [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/) (agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information) in order to create the French team for [ECSC](https://ecsc.eu/) (european cyber security challenge).   
I have been participating casually for the last 2 years but this year I invested a reasonable amount of time into it. Not as much as I would have wanted to due to classes but I still managed to rank 310th in the general ranking and 27h in the junior ranking with 1381 points which is pretty good.  

I solved 21 challenges some of them have writeups some not. Some of them where part of the intro category which consistof easier challenges of various categories they are marked with `(intro)` after the name.
