# Spooky CTF

The Spooky CTF is organised by NICC, NJIT's information & cybersecurity club.   
You can check them out on [njiticc.com](https://njiticc.com/).  

I mostly did bin (pwn and reverse) challenges as I started the CTF quite late.  
Here are the challenges I did :

## Bin

- The gates are close
- B00fer
- My assm hurts
- What flag

## Web 

- Paranormal picture

## Forensic

- Won't somebody think of the children
