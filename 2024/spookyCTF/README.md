# Spooky CTF

The Spooky CTF is organised by NICC, NJIT's information & cybersecurity club.   
You can check them out on [njiticc.com](https://njiticc.com/).  

I mostly did bin (pwn and reverse) challenges as I started the CTF quite late.  
Here are the challenges I did :

## Bin

- [The gates are closed](./the_gates_are_closed/README.md)
- [B00fer](./B00fer/README.md)
- [My assm hurts](./my_assm_hurst/README.md)
- [What flag](./what_flag/README.md)

## Web 

- Paranormal picture (no writeup, it was easy)

## Forensic

- [Won't somebody think of the children](./wont_somebody_think_of_the_children/README.md)
